# Doppl Fork

This is a fork of the Mockito library to provide tests and modifications to support
iOS development with J2objc using the [Doppl build framework](http://doppl.co/).

## Usage

```groovy
dependencies {
    testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.9.5'
    testDoppl 'co.doppl.org.mockito:mockito-core:1.9.5.0'
}
```

## Status

Extracted from master J2objc. Mock is supported, but not spy. Updates coming...
